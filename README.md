# Curve Storage: a database to store, find and save efficiently scientific datasets

This is a small python library made to interact with a PostGreSQL database server, used to store the metadatas of some curves that are stored somewhere. It comprises a GUI that allows easy visualisation, filtered search, fitting and deletion/editing of curves. 

## Installation

First you need a running PostgreSQL server. For a detailed description of how to install PostgreSQL and launch a server, see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/admin.html


After this, to install the library, open a command line after having installed git, then go to the repository you want to store it, then do: 

```bash
git clone http://gitea.qmpl.xyz/ThibaultCapelle/curve_storage.git 

cd curve_storage 

pip install psycopg2 pyqtgraph==0.11.0 

pip install â€“e . 
```
 Then open a python console, and type: 
```python
from curve_storage.database import SQLDatabase 

SQLDatabase.set_config() 
```

### Basic use
To create a cuvre, simply enter:
```python
from curve_storage.database import Curve
curve=Curve(x_data, y_data, name='example', project='example_project',
 sample='example_sample', extra_param_name='example_value')
 ```
Each curve has two numpy arrays, assumed to be complex, which represents usually the x and y values to store, as well as a dictionnary with various parameters, here the extra_param_name, but it can be a lot of them. On top of it, it has special params linked to the database and which therefore can be searched with filters: a unique id, a name, a sample, a project and a date. It also has a dedicated folder that can be used, as well as a hierarchical system: each curve can have a parent and multiple childs.
